## How to Host Your Portfolio on a Website

To host your portfolio on a website, follow the steps below:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

2. In the VSCode terminal, run the command `npm run build`. This will create a build folder.

3. Locate the `dist` folder within the project. Inside the `dist` folder, you will find an `assets` folder and an `index.html` file.

4. Copy both the `assets` folder and the `index.html` file.

5. Paste the copied `assets` folder and `index.html` file into your web host server.

That's it! Your portfolio should now be hosted on your website. Visitors can access it by navigating to the appropriate URL on your web host server.

Feel free to customize your website and make any necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.
